This project is my solution to Frontend Mentor's [Github Jobs API Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-jobs-api-93L-NL6rP).

## [Demo](https://githubjob-challenge.netlify.app/)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` to install all the dependencies

### `npm start` to start the app

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
